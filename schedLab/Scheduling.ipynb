    "* arrival - the time at which the task is first initiated\n",

    "* burst_fun - a function that returns the length of the next CPU burst, given its elapsed execution time.  This can be viewed as the time to the next syscall.  A value of 0 is taken to be run-to-completion.  A periodic application simply returns a constant, the number of time units in each burst duration.  A stochastic model is obtained by drawing a value according to some distribution.\n",
